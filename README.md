# VibrationsProject01
First project containing solutions to problems in my project assignment
## Questions:
The questions are given below:

1. Derive and plot the free-vibration response of a viscously damped single-degree-of-freedom
system with m = 4 kg, k = 2500 N/m, x<sub>0</sub> = 0.15 m, v<sub>0</sub> = -20 m/s for the following values of
the damping constant: (soln in [question1.py file](./question1.py))

(i) c = 0 N-s/m, (ii) c = 100 N-s/m, (iii) c = 200 N-s/m, (iv) c = 400 N-s/m


2. Consider a spring-mass-damper system with k = 4000 N/m, m = 10 kg, and c = 40 N-s/m.
Derive and plot the steady-state and total responses of the system under the excitation forces
listed below. Initial conditions are x<sub>0</sub> = 0.1 m and  ̇x<sub>0</sub> = 10 m/s.

(i) F(t) = 100 cos 10t, (ii) F(t) = 100 cos 20t

3.Derive and plot the free-vibration response of the system given in the figure below. System
parameters are as follows: k1 = 1000 N/m, k2 = 500 N/m, m1 = 2 kg, m2 = 1 kg. Solve the
system for the following two sets of initial conditions and then plot the general solutions.

(i) x1(0) = 1 m, x2(0) = 2 m,  ̇x1(0) = 1 m/s,  ̇x2(0) = -2 m/s
(ii) x1(0) = 1 m, x2(0) = 0 m,  ̇x1(0) = -1 m/s,  ̇x2(0) = 0 m/s
